** Motivation

The main motivation of this package is to make it
easy to interact with ~org-mode~ and
~papis~.

We do not want to reinvent the wheel, so this project
should be thought to play well with the very good
package [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]].


** Disclaimer

If you're an emacs lisp hacker, feel free to chip in.
Otherwise this project should be treated as Î² software
and it might just completely change in the future.


** What is implemented

I have implemented some functions that I use in my day-to-day
research and worfklow.

There is a `papis-ivy` function to open and so on,
and org mode links.

At some point it will get documented...
